# OverviewPlot
A relatively simple plotting routine that plots a property of a 4 dimensional grid for each parameter value. Allow for more detailed look at specific grid points by clicking the point in question (a red dot will appear) and pressing enter. This will all a user defined plotting routine which is passed the properties of the selected gridpoint. 

The data has to be fairly structured, with discrete parameter values. However, OverviewPlot can handle gaps in the data. 

Refer to the example for most of the functionality. 

OverviewPlot requires matplotlib, numpy and scipy to work.
